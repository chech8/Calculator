# Calculator app
A simple calculator app bootstrapped with Next.js and using TypeScript.

Unlike most calculator app examples on the internet, this one is being designed with new feature scalability in mind. Thanks to 'evaluate' function from Math.js library, adding new operators to this calculator can be done easily by just declaring it as a button in the layout, as long as they are compatible with Math.js. Any special function buttons (AC, Del, etc.) will require an extra declaration of their function.

## To-Do
- Allow text input on expression display
- Add more operators
- Add tests
