# Calculator app
A simple calculator app bootstrapped with Next.js and using TypeScript.

Unlike most calculator app examples on the internet, this one is being designed with scalability in mind.

## To-Do
- Clean up Display state management.
- Prevent the user from using multiple operands in a row.
- Text is appended to the result after using '='.
- Stop the calculator from displaying floating point inaccuracies.
