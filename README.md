# Calculator app
A simple calculator app bootstrapped with Next.js and using TypeScript.

Unlike most calculator app examples on the internet, this one is being designed with new feature scalability in mind. Thanks to 'evaluate' function from Math.js library, adding new operators to this calculator can be done easily, by just declaring it as a button in the layout. Although functional buttons (AC, Del, etc.) will need an extra declaration of what they intend to do.

## To-Do
- Add docker production
- Add more operators
